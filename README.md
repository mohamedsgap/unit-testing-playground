# Unit Testing Playground!

Built this repository for demonstrating the unit testing for `React apps` with `Jest` and `Enzyme`.

In this repository I build an app called Jotto, let us to guess the words and give us a feedback messaging if our guess id true, flase and provide us with the matching characters in the guessing word.

This app has two implementation one with `Redux` and the other with `Hooks`, and I used `Jest` to test the both implementation veriosn of the code!

**Note**: This app has backend for randomly choosing a new word every time the user trying to guess! it's not provide in this repository because in `unit testing` we are not testing the API, we just mock it!
